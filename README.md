# SPADERS

This repository hosts material for the Semi-Periodic Agricultural &amp; Development Economics Research Symposium (SPADERS) held at the University of Sydney. 

The inaugural meeting will happen on 19 May 2023. 

As the name of the event suggests, this is envisaged to be a series of workshops held semi-periodically, often timed to maximize the presence of international visitors. 

The goal of the event is to facilitate the dissemination of the existing research and, importantly, the emergence of new collaborative relationships among the participants.
